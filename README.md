# haskell-hud-menu

Provides a way to run menubar commands through a searchable list, written in Haskell.
This project was created mostly for fun and to learn Haskell, and is not intended for
general usage (at least quite yet).

## TODO

- Add support for more interfaces (org.gtk.Menus, new style GTK menus, whatever KDE/Qt uses, ...)
- Systemd service file for AppmenuRegistrar implementation & move to separate project
- Improve performance
- Improve readability
